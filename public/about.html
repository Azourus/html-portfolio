<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi there! I'm Leonard Hodge, a 33-year-old web developer from the beautiful
  island of Cura√ßao. I'm fueled by a passion for all things tech, and when I'm
  not diving headfirst into new coding challenges, you can find me playing video
  games, enjoying movies, or spending quality time with my other half. Take a
  look around, I'm excited to share my work with you!
